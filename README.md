# 📊 Data Engineering with dlt

Welcome to my public learning journey with [dlt](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) — an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build robust, modern ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) pipelines with minimal code.

### 🎯 Goal

This repository is a hands-on, beginner-to-advanced guide to learning `dlt`. It includes weekly examples, use cases, and walkthroughs — from ingesting data from APIs and databases to integrating with Airbyte, dbt, and cloud warehouses.

Whether you're new to data engineering or looking to streamline your pipeline development, this repo will guide you through:

- ✅ Ingesting data from public APIs, files, and databases
- ✅ Loading data to destinations like BigQuery, DuckDB, and PostgreSQL
- ✅ Integrating with Airbyte and dbt for scalable pipeline orchestration
- ✅ Building reusable, production-ready Python pipelines

### 📅 Weekly Learning Series

Each week, I explore a new feature or use case, share my learnings, and post a tutorial or project here. You can also follow along on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahadi-nagassou-850a87254/)) for bite-sized updates and context.
